# Commercial License

## Dual Licensing

This project is available under two licenses:

1. **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** — for open-source use
2. **Commercial License** — for proprietary/commercial use

## When You Need a Commercial License

The AGPL-3.0 requires that if you run a modified version of this software as a network service, you must make your complete source code available to users of that service. A commercial license removes this obligation.

**You need a commercial license if you:**

- Use this software in a proprietary SaaS product or internal service
- Want to modify the software without sharing your changes
- Cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 obligations in your organization
- Need commercial support, SLA guarantees, or custom features

**You do NOT need a commercial license if you:**

- Use the software for personal or educational purposes
- Contribute back all modifications under AGPL-3.0
- Run the software internally and comply with AGPL-3.0 terms
